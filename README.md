                As a tennis referee
I want to manage the score of a game of a set of a tennis match between 2 players with simple Game rules
In order to display the current Game score of each player
 
                Rules details:
-          The game starts with a score of 0 point for each player
-          Each time a player win a point, the Game score changes as follow:
0 -> 15 -> 30 -> 40-> Win game
